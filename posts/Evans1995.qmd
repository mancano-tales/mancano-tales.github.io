What are the central research questions or problems raised by the authors? 

What core concepts, evidence, and research methods are utilized? 

As you do the readings, think about what the author did right as well as wrong.  

What are the interesting ideas in the paper?  

If you disagree with an argument, what would it require to persuade you?  

Can these differences be adjudicated through further empirical study?  


## Personal Notes and highlights

Uma coisa que me marcou nesse livro

Eu não soumuito fã desse estudo de livro, é meio confuso para mim, As metáforas são legais, mas a forma como constroi o problema teórico, bem, não é tanto a minha praia. Fico pensando nas confounders e em perder o ponto/

(a)	ideas, concepts, arguments that you found stimulating, worth remembering and building on,
(b)	questions, concerns, disagreements with ideas encountered,
(c)	connections, linkages, contradictions between one idea or approach and another.

Short memos are due by 5pm Monday, the day before class. A third of your course grade will be based on the short memos. Please submit them through Canvas.

2.  Long memos: For four of the topics, students will prepare a more detailed memo (5 pages) assessing the weekly readings.  You choose which week’s readings you wish to analyze, but you must complete this assignment before the date the topic is discussed in class.  The purpose of the longer memos is to help you grapple with the readings and respond with questions, criticisms, and new ideas.  The main thrust of the longer memos should be on developing promising research ideas suggested by the readings.  We strongly encourage you use the long memos as a vehicle for advancing your own work. When you choose to write a longer memo about a particular topic, you should consult the additional readings for that week.  Longer memos are due by 9am on Tuesdays. A third of your course grade is based on the long memos.

3.	All students should arrive at class with questions, topics, and issues to be vetted and debated. You should come to class prepared to answer: What are the central research questions or problems raised by the authors? What core concepts, evidence, and research methods are utilized? As you do the readings, think about what the author did right as well as wrong.  What are the interesting ideas in the paper?  If you disagree with an argument, what would it require to persuade you?  Can these differences be adjudicated through further empirical study?  A good seminar should have active dialog and debate.  If someone proposes an idea that is contrary to your view, speak up.  I will often be intentionally provocative, so be prepared to push back.  Your task is to engage one another in an assessment of the readings.

## Note 

This post was first written as a reading exercise for the course [**EDUC 306B**](../2026-01-02-EDUC-306B/), this was my second reading of the text.

## Overview

In **EDUC 306B: Global Education Policy & Organization** we recently delved into the work of **Peter Evans**, specifically his 1995 most famous book, **. 

Evans provides a critical framework for understanding why some states succeed at industrialization while others fail, focusing on the internal structure of the state and its relationship with society.

---

## 🏗️ What is "Embedded Autonomy"?

The central thesis of the book is that the state’s ability to transform its economy depends on a unique structural combination:

* **Autonomy (Corporate Coherence):** A professional, meritocratic bureaucracy that can act independently of narrow interest groups.
* **Embeddedness (Social Ties):** A dense network of connections to the private sector that allows the state to gather information and implement policy.

> "The state must be sufficiently autonomous to avoid being captured, but sufficiently embedded to be effective." 

### State Archetypes
Evans contrasts different types of states based on their developmental outcomes:

| State Type | Characteristics | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Developmental** | High Embedded Autonomy; fosters growth. | South Korea |
| **Intermediate** | Mixed capacity; inconsistent results. | Brazil, India |
| **Predatory** | Lacks autonomy; extracts wealth from society. | Zaire (DRC) |

## 🛠️ The Four Roles of the State

Evans identifies how states engage with the industrial sector, particularly in high-tech fields like informatics during the 1970s and 80s:

1.  **Custodian:** The regulator. Focuses on "policing" and setting legal frameworks.
2.  **Demiurge:** The producer. The state acts as a player by creating State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).
3.  **Midwifery:** The promoter. Fostering the birth of new private sector firms through protection or incentives.
4.  **Husbandry:** The nurturer. Supporting existing firms to help them navigate global competition and R&D.

---

## 🌎 Case Studies: Brazil, India, and Korea

Evans uses an **institutional comparative approach** to analyze the IT and computer industries. He argues that:

* **South Korea** succeeded through a combination of *Midwifery* and *Husbandry*, moving quickly into global markets.
* **Brazil and India** initially focused on the *Demiurge* and *Custodian* roles, which provided mixed results in the high-tech sector.

The lesson for us in **EDUC 306B** is clear: industrial and educational outcomes are not just about "good policy"—they depend on the **character of the state structures** that implement them.

---

## 💡 Personal Reflection

Reading Evans helps bridge the gap between "politics" and "economics." It suggests that for educational reforms to be successful, the state must not only have the *will* to change but also the *institutional capacity* and *social connections* to see that change through.

**Would you like me to help you draft a specific section comparing the "Husbandry" role in Brazil versus South Korea based on Evans' analysis?**
