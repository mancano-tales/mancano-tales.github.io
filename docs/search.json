    "title": "Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

    "text": "Description\nEDUC 306B: Global Education Policy & Organization. “The Politics of Education Policy”\nProposed Course Objectives: The objectives of this course are (1) to introduce students to the nature of some current major debates in educational reforms from a political economy point of view; (2) to give students a grasp of various conceptions of the State—of the workings of the “political system” and the political structures in society; and, through this understanding, (3) to be able better to conduct policy analyses of education, interpret the meaning of existing educational structures and of educational reforms and gain insights into theories of educational change. Although most educational policy is developed within the context of the national State, in the past fifty years there have been important—and some say, increasing—political influences on national States from international organizations. We will also analyze literature on globalization and global governance and try to come to some conclusions about the importance of those influences. By the end of the course, everyone should have a clear idea of how to analyze education policy through a political economy approach and with an explicit theory of the state.\n\n\nFirst Impressions (2026-01-01)\nO cusrso est’’a organiado em 18 seções que mesclam teorias mais abstratas sobre o Estado com discussões bastante aplicadas sobre políticas específicas\nCarnoy faz muito bme o que podemos chamar de debate paradigmático da educação, educação não é nem só um investimento tal qual um investimento em capital produtivol, nem simplesmente uma forma de dominação e doutrinação das classes dominantes, nem apenas um instrumento redistributivo e de libertação, depede de qual educação se fala e embora um ou outro modelo educacional possa ser pretominante em determinado país reguão ou momento histórco ou a educação destinada a grupos específicos, geralmente vemos diversidades de educac’~ao e resuktadis\nConforme discutido em no post sobre Embedded Autonomy"

Focuses on “policing” and setting legal frameworks.\nDemiurge: The producer. The state acts as a player by creating State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).\nMidwifery: The promoter. Fostering the birth of new private sector firms through protection or incentives.\nHusbandry: The nurturer. Supporting existing firms to help them navigate global competition and R&D."
