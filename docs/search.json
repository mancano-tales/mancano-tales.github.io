    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

    "text": "Description\nEDUC 306B: Global Education Policy & Organization. “The Politics of Education Policy”\nProposed Course Objectives: The objectives of this course are (1) to introduce students to the nature of some current major debates in educational reforms from a political economy point of view; (2) to give students a grasp of various conceptions of the State—of the workings of the “political system” and the political structures in society; and, through this understanding, (3) to be able better to conduct policy analyses of education, interpret the meaning of existing educational structures and of educational reforms and gain insights into theories of educational change. Although most educational policy is developed within the context of the national State, in the past fifty years there have been important—and some say, increasing—political influences on national States from international organizations. We will also analyze literature on globalization and global governance and try to come to some conclusions about the importance of those influences. By the end of the course, everyone should have a clear idea of how to analyze education policy through a political economy approach and with an explicit theory of the state.\n\n\nFirst Impressions (2026-01-01)\nO cusrso est’’a organiado em 18 seções que mesclam teorias mais abstratas sobre o Estado com discussões bastante aplicadas sobre políticas específicas, a disciplina alterna questões teóricas com estudos de caso.\nO curso começa com uma aula introdutoria sobre porque estado importa, vai para as teorias liberais e do mecano, depois cobre o debate entre institucionalistas e gramscianos,,pluralistas, raça, gênero, socialismo etc. Uma pergunta a ser feita para o Carnoy é “How many theories of State are there? What does a theory have to be to be considered a theory of the State?”\nCarnoy faz muito bme o que podemos chamar de debate paradigmático da educação, educação não é nem só um investimento tal qual um investimento em capital produtivol, nem simplesmente uma forma de dominação e doutrinação das classes dominantes, nem apenas um instrumento redistributivo e de libertação, depede de qual educação se fala e embora um ou outro modelo educacional possa ser pretominante em determinado país reguão ou momento histórco ou a educação destinada a grupos específicos, geralmente vemos diversidades de educac’~ao e resuktadis\nClass titles:\n\n\nSession 1, Week 1, Monday, January 5: Why Does the State Matter in Educational Policy Analysis?\nSession 2, Week 1, Wednesday, January 7: Case Study 1: Educational Privatization in the Low-income Countries\nSession 3, Week 2, Monday, January 12: Theories of the State: Dependency Theory and Embedded Autonomy\nSession 4, Week 2, Wednesday, January 14: Case Study 2: Educational Privatization in Middle-and High-income Countries\nSession 5, Week 3, Wednesday, January 21: Theories of the State: Liberal Common Good Theories and Markets\nSession 6, Week 4, Monday, January 26: Case Study 3: Public Sector Accountability Reforms (including Standards Reforms)\nSession 7, Week 4, Wednesday, January 28: Theories of the State: The Institutionalists versus the Gramscians\nSession 8, Week 5, Monday, February 2: Case Study 4: Vocational Education in Europe and Brazil\nSession 9, Week 5, Wednesday, February 4: Theories of the State: Educational Borrowing and Education and Legitimacy\nSession 10, Week 6, Monday, February 9: Case Study 5: Persistent Achievement Gaps across Race, Class, and Gender\nSession 11, Week 6, Wednesday, February 11: Theories of the State: Pluralists, Class Conflict, and Social Reproduction\nSession 12, Week 7, Wednesday, February 18: Theories of the State: The Racial State and Racial Capitalism\nSession 13, Week 8, Monday, February 23: Theories of the State: Gender and the State\nSession 14, Week 8, Wednesday, February 25: Case Study 6: PISA, TIMSS, and the Global Institutions\nSession 15, Week 9, Monday, March 2: Theories of the State: Globalization and the Decline of the Nation State?\nSession 16, Week 9, Wednesday, March 4: Case Study 7: Education in Transition in Cuba and China\nSession 17, Week 10, Monday, March 9: Theories of the State: Socialist States and States in Transition\nSession 18, Week 10, Wednesday, March 11: Course Wrap-up, Q&A, Discussion of Final Paper\n\n\nClasses Notes:\n\nSession 1: Why Does the State Matter in Educational Policy Analysis?\n\nno post sobre Embedded Autonomy\nno post sobre Embedded Autonomy\n\n\n\nConforme discutido em Carnoy1989"

    "text": "O Estado e a Educação: Uma Perspectiva Político-Econômica\nOs sistemas educacionais modernos desempenham um papel econômico e social fundamental, profundamente moldado pelas relações de poder econômico e social refletidas no Estado-nação. Poder e Estrutura do Estado: Escolas e instituições de ensino superior são majoritariamente públicas e, portanto, produtos de forças político-econômicas. O texto argumenta que as diferenças inerentes de renda e riqueza nas economias de mercado capitalistas criam uma estrutura de classe social ou quase-classe que influencia as desigualdades de poder. Essa estrutura de poder desigual na democracia capitalista, onde a riqueza se traduz em poder político, fornece a estrutura para uma teoria política da educação. Apesar da influência do poder econômico de uma minoria, a democracia é a principal instituição através da qual a maioria pode pressionar por políticas redistributivas, como o aumento de impostos sobre os ricos para financiar escolas com menos recursos. Conflito e Legitimidade: O sistema educacional é um local central de conflito entre a desigualdade do mercado e a promessa democrática de mobilidade social e direitos humanos, incluindo igualdade de oportunidades. O sistema educacional busca reproduzir as desigualdades de renda e riqueza, mas também é um local de luta por direitos e oportunidades. A educação serve como uma fonte de legitimidade para o Estado ao tentar gerenciar o conflito entre a democracia e as relações de poder desiguais da economia de mercado. Conflito por Recursos: As relações de poder são claras no conflito sobre como os recursos públicos são distribuídos no sistema educacional. O gasto público em alunos de classes sociais mais baixas, especialmente em sistemas financeiros descentralizados, tende a ser menor do que em seus equivalentes de classes sociais mais altas. Um debate político e ideológico questiona se o aumento do gasto público melhora o desempenho dos alunos. Estudos mais recentes sugerem que o aumento do gasto por aluno tem um impacto positivo significativo nos resultados educacionais para distritos escolares de baixa renda. Capital Social Gerado pelo Estado: O Estado pode investir em capital social (como segurança e redução da exploração do trabalho infantil) para complementar o capital humano, influenciando o sucesso acadêmico, especialmente para crianças de classes sociais mais baixas. Os estados socialistas autoritários, por exemplo, foram mais bem-sucedidos do que os capitalistas na entrega de educação de massa de alta qualidade devido ao maior investimento e ao capital social socialista (ênfase na igualdade, segurança e alto valor na educação)."

    "text": "O texto de Martin Carnoy avança no debate paradigmário, ou na discussão sobre ontologias educacionias, talvez seja um dos primeiros textos a ressaltar isso tão fortemtente, conforme faz Paulo Freire também. Talvez uma das principais virtudes de Carnoy é ter se misturado tão fortemtente com tantas tradições diferentes de politica educacional, possibilitanto o desenvolvimento dessa perspectiva\nO texto de Martin Carnoy analisa o sistema educacional dos Estados Unidos como um espaço de conflito político e cultural entre a ideologia dominante das classes empresariais e as aspirações de grupos subordinados. O autor explora como o Estado utiliza as escolas para promover a legitimação política e o desenvolvimento econômico, tentando integrar imigrantes e minorias em uma cultura nacional que favoreça a produtividade capitalista. Contudo, essa dinâmica não é unilateral, pois os movimentos sociais pressionam as instituições por maior igualdade e currículos inclusivos, transformando a educação em uma arena de resistência e negociação constante. Em última análise, a obra busca demonstrar que o ensino público serve tanto para a reprodução da estrutura de classes quanto como um campo fértil para a emergência de contra-hegemonias que desafiam o status quo."
